			<p>It is equally good to replace melted butter with liquid maragirin of any brand. - I can not understand why melted butter / liquid margarine should be mixed down SIST, then it just floats up and sits on top of the batter. I ALWAYS mix the fat before all the milk is added, then mix it so that it stays in the batter and will benefit from grilling. The basic recipe is simple, good and works well. 2/5.<br>
