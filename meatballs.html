			<p>My grandmother was a swedish immigrant who came to America in 1843. She always used to cook us some swedish meatballs, sadly she passed away 20 years ago and I never aqcuired the recipe from her. I used this recipe today and sadly it doesn't taste like mormors kötbullar. 1/5.<br>

			<p>Just took these out of the oven, they smell heavenly! I do think next time I make them I will season them up a little bit more before baking, with some Italian seasoning. They were very easy to make, I will definitely keep this recipe handy. 4/5.<br>
